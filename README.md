<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

Front-End Repo: https://github.com/viictorcamposs/imageUploaderFrontEnd

This is my first API project built with no help, it was a pleasure to build and have so many problems to resolve, like have to connect with MongoDB and set up the CRUD when I've no more than four days learning the language.

More important than the technical experience was the thought process. Having a problem and stop, think about it, research, read documentation and in the end have the feeling of success.
